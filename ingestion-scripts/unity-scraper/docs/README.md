# Unity Scraper GUI Documentation

This directory is reserved for future GUI documentation.

## Planned Features

A graphical user interface for the Unity Asset Store scraper will include:

- **Configuration interface** - Easy setup of scraping options
- **Progress tracking** - Real-time progress bar and status updates
- **Log viewing** - Color-coded output for easy monitoring
- **Post-processing tab** - Integrated HTML to Markdown conversion
- **Start/Stop controls** - Graceful process management

## Current Status

GUI not yet implemented. The scraper currently runs via command-line only.

For command-line usage, see [../scraping/README.md](../scraping/README.md).
