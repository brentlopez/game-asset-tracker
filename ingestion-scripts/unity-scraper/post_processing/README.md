# Post-Processing

This directory is reserved for future post-processing tools.

## Planned Features

- **HTML to Markdown conversion** - Similar to fab-scraper, convert Unity Asset Store descriptions to clean Markdown
- **Data enrichment** - Add additional metadata or normalize existing fields
- **Validation** - Ensure scraped data conforms to expected schema

## Current Status

Not yet implemented. Unity Asset Store descriptions are currently stored as-is in the output JSON.
